    "text": "Hi, I’m Ama Quansah, a Master of Arts student in Communication Studies at Texas Tech University. My work focuses on health, organizational, and intercultural communication. Lately, I have been exploring how people find and understand health information online, how they respond to health risks, and how we can make reliable health information more accessible. Whether it’s understanding vaccine hesitancy, policy resistance, or the spread of misinformation, I believe effective communication can play a powerful role in building trust and promoting healthier outcomes for all.\nThis website is in progress! I’ll be updating with new research, and all things communication.\n\nEducation\n\n    \n        Master of Arts in Communication Studies, Texas Tech University, 2024 - Present\n    \n    \n       Bachelor of Commerce in Marketing, University of Cape Coast, Ghana, 2021"
