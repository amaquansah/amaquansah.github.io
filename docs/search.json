My research focuses on the power of organizational, interpersonal, and intercultural communication. Iâ€™m passionate about how effective communication within organizations can boost efficiency, foster collaboration, and tackle socio-economic challenges. Iâ€™m also interested in exploring how communication can contribute to public health efforts, especially examining public reactions to health policies and interventions.\nThis website is a work in progressâ€”just like my research! Iâ€™ll be updating it regularly with new insights, findings, and all things communication. Stay tuned for the latest updates, and Iâ€™m excited to have you along for the ride! ðŸš€\n\nEducation\n\n    \n        M.A. Communications | Texas Tech University, Lubbock, 2024 - Present\n    \n    \n       B.Com.
